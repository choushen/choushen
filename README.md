## Hello / こんにちは / 你好
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my C++, TypeScript and Python skills so expect to see more of that on my GitHub.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything. I'm interested in test automation, CI/CD, web development, computer graphics and AI.
- 💬 I specialise in building scalable test solutions using Selenium, Playwright, Appium and Cypress using C#, Python, TypeScript and Java and integrating them into CI/CD tooling such as Jenkins, Bamboo, GitHub Actions and Azure. 
- 🗣 I'm fluent in English, able to converse in Japanese, and currently trying to improve my Chinese Mandarin skills.

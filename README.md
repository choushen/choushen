## Hello / こんにちは / 你好
- 🎓  Computer Science Graduate
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my C++, TypeScript and Python skills so expect to see more of that on my GitHub. However, I'm comfortable using C# and Java. I work with C# every day and Java got me through uni, ah how could I forget ... :-)
- ⭐ Outside of testing, I enjoy game development, computer graphics and mobile applications using ReactNative, building web applications using ReactTS, DaisyUI (TailwindCSS), AI frameworks such as LangChain.
- 💬 I specialise in building scalable test solutions using Selenium, Playwright, Appium and Cypress using C#, Python, TypeScript and Java and integrating them into CI/CD tooling such as Jenkins, Bamboo, GitHub Actions and Azure. 
- 🗣 I'm fluent in English, able to converse in Japanese, and currently trying to improve my Chinese Mandarin skills.
- ℹ️ Below are some testing projects that are not listed in the pinned section of my profile:
  - [xunit-browserstack-poc](https://github.com/choushen/xunit-browserstack-poc)

  - [java-allure-test-framework](https://github.com/choushen/java-allure-test-framework)
- 🎯My goal is to keep growing as a SDET/Dev. There's always some new technology or a better way to do things. I want to stay ahead of the curve.
